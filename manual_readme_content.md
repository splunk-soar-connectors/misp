Misp will return integers which correspond to various values. Here is the complete list:  
  
For **distribution** :  

-   0: Your Org Only
-   1: This Community Only
-   2: Connected Communities
-   3: All Communities
-   4: Sharing Group
-   5: Inherit

  
For **threat level id** :  

-   1: High
-   2: Medium
-   3: Low
-   4: Undefined

  
For **analysis** :  

-   0: Initial
-   1: Ongoing
-   2: Completed

  
**Note:**

-   There is no validation provided in case of an incorrect value in the 'json' action parameter of
    the **'create event'** and **'update event'** actions. Hence, the action will pass even if an
    incorrect attribute value is passed in the 'json' action parameter and no attributes will be
    added.

-   The value of the attribute passed in the 'json' action parameter of **'create event'** and
    **'update event'** will be treated as a list if a list is specified. If a string is specified
    then a list will be created by splitting the string by comma (,). For example:

    -   json: {"email_body": \["body 1", "body 2"\], "ip-dst": "8.8.8.8, 12.4.6.34"}

    The value of the 'email_body' will be considered a list and the value of the 'ip-dst' will be
    converted to a list having two elements(\["8.8.8.8", "12.4.6.34"\]).

-   In the **'run query'** action, tags containing a comma (,) in its value can be passed through
    the 'other' action parameter. For example:

    -   other: {"tags": \["tag1, tag11", "tag_2"\]}

    "tag1, tag11" will be considered a single tag.
